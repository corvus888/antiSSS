# 📈 Quantitative Mathematics Roadmap for Finance

---

## Stage 1: Foundations (4–6 months)

Before stochastic calculus or finance models, you need solid fundamentals.

### 🔹 Linear Algebra

* Goal: Understand matrices, eigenvalues, decomposition, vector spaces (essential for PCA, regression, risk modeling).
* Resources:

* Strang – Introduction to Linear Algebra (applied, intuitive).
* MIT OCW: Gilbert Strang lectures (free).
* Topics:

* Vector spaces, bases, orthogonality
* Eigenvalues & eigenvectors, spectral decomposition
* Matrix factorizations (LU, QR, SVD)
* Positive definite matrices (covariance matrices in finance)

---

### 🔹 Calculus & Real Analysis

* Goal: Comfort with differentiation, integration, limits, multivariable calculus.
* Resources:

* Stewart – Calculus (practical, applied)
* Rudin – Principles of Mathematical Analysis (for rigor later)
* Topics:

* Single & multivariable calculus
* Taylor expansions
* Partial derivatives, gradients, Jacobians, Hessians
* Optimization (Lagrange multipliers, convexity)

(Directly useful for risk optimization, utility maximization, ML for finance).

## Stage 2: Probability & Statistics (4–6 months)

### 🔹 Probability

* Goal: Build probability theory intuition + measure-theoretic foundations for stochastic processes.
* Resources:

* Ross – A First Course in Probability (beginner → applied)
* Blitzstein & Hwang – Introduction to Probability
* Billingsley – Probability and Measure (advanced)
* Topics:

* Random variables, distributions, expectation, variance
* Law of large numbers, central limit theorem
* Conditional probability, Bayes theorem
* Generating functions, moment generating functions
* Joint distributions, independence, covariance

---

### 🔹 Statistics

* Goal: Inference and estimation for data + model calibration.
* Resources:

* Casella & Berger – Statistical Inference
* Wasserman – All of Statistics (condensed, finance-friendly)
* Topics:

* Point estimation (MLE, method of moments)
* Confidence intervals, hypothesis testing
* Regression (linear, logistic)
* Time series basics (AR, MA, ARMA, ARCH/GARCH)

---

## Stage 3: Advanced Probability & Measure Theory (3–4 months)

* Goal: Transition from “undergrad” probability to measure-theoretic probability, needed for stochastic calculus.
* Resources:

* Williams – Probability with Martingales
* Chung – A Course in Probability Theory
* Topics:

* σ-algebras, measurable functions
* Expectation as Lebesgue integral
* Martingales, stopping times
* Convergence concepts (a.s., in probability, in distribution, L²)

---

## Stage 4: Stochastic Calculus (6–8 months)

### 🔹 Beginner-Friendly Start

* Shreve – Stochastic Calculus for Finance I & II
Vol I: discrete-time, binomial models
Vol II: continuous-time, Ito calculus, Black–Scholes, risk-neutral pricing

### 🔹 More Advanced

* Karatzas & Shreve – Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus (measure-theoretic depth)
* Bjork – Arbitrage Theory in Continuous Time (finance-focused, intuitive)
* Mikosch – Elementary Stochastic Calculus with Finance in View

### 🔹 Topics

* Brownian motion, filtration, adapted processes
* Ito’s lemma (multivariate)
* Stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
* Martingale representation theorem
* Girsanov’s theorem & change of measure
* Black–Scholes model derivation
* Interest rate models (Vasicek, CIR, HJM)

---

## Stage 5: Mathematical Finance Integration (6–12 months)

Now apply math tools to finance models.

### 🔹 Core Resources

* Neftci – An Introduction to the Mathematics of Financial Derivatives
* Joshi – The Concepts and Practice of Mathematical Finance
* Baxter & Rennie – Financial Calculus
* Wilmott – Paul Wilmott Introduces Quantitative Finance

### 🔹 Topics

* Derivatives pricing (options, forwards, futures, swaps)
* Risk-neutral valuation
* Greeks and hedging
* PDE methods (heat equation ↔ Black–Scholes)
* Monte Carlo methods for pricing & risk
* Portfolio optimization (Markowitz, CAPM extensions)
* Advanced: Credit risk models, stochastic volatility (Heston), jumps (Merton, Lévy processes)

---

## Stage 6: Applied & Computational Math for Quants

Parallel with theory, you need computational skills:

* Numerical Methods:

* Monte Carlo simulation (variance reduction)
* Finite difference methods for PDEs
* Optimization algorithms

* Programming:

* Python (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, statsmodels)
* C++ or Julia for performance
* Machine learning methods (regression, SVM, neural nets in quant research)

* Resources:

* Glasserman – Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering
* Numerical Recipes (for algorithms)
* Python for Finance (Yves Hilpisch)

---

# 🛠 Suggested Timeline (for a full roadmap)

* Year 1: Foundations (linear algebra, calculus, probability & stats basics)
* Year 2 (first half): Measure theory + advanced probability → start stochastic calculus
* Year 2 (second half): Stochastic calculus + finance integration (Shreve, Bjork, Wilmott)
* Year 3+: Specialize in asset pricing, risk, or ML for finance
