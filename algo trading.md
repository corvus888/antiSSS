 **zero-to-advanced roadmap** for becoming an **algorithmic trader**, with **clear phases, projects, resources, and certifications** 🚀

#  Algorithmic Trading Roadmap — From Zero to Advanced

**Outcome:** Build a real portfolio of strategies, master risk & execution, and be ready for paper/live trading.
**Stack:** Python (pandas, numpy, statsmodels, arch, scikit-learn, backtrader, PyPortfolioOpt), Jupyter, Git, Docker.

##  Main Subfields

1. **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)** – Ultra-fast execution of thousands of trades in milliseconds.  
2. **Statistical Arbitrage** – Exploiting statistical price relationships between correlated assets.  
3. **Pairs Trading** – Trading two historically correlated assets using **cointegration**.  
4. **Market Making** – Providing liquidity by continuously placing buy/sell orders and profiting from the bid-ask spread.  
5. **Trend Following** – Using indicators or time-series analysis to follow market trends.  
6. **Mean Reversion** – Betting that price will revert to its historical mean.  
7. **Event-Driven Trading** – Trading based on events (earnings, news, economic data).

##  Popular Python Libraries

| Category               | Libraries |
|------------------------|-----------|
| **Data Analysis**      | `pandas`, `numpy` |
| **Visualization**      | `matplotlib`, `plotly` |
| **Financial Data**     | `yfinance`, `TA-Lib` |

##  Learning Phases & Timeline (suggested 6–8 months)

### Phase 0 — Foundations (2–3 weeks)

* Python for data: `pandas`, `numpy`, plotting, environments (`venv`/`conda`)
* Market basics: order types, bid-ask, leverage, slippage, margin, shorting 
* Math refresh: logs/returns, compounding, expectations, variance, covariance

**Mini-Project:** Clean & visualize OHLCV for 5 tickers; compute log returns, rolling mean/vol, drawdowns; export a one-page report (PNG + Markdown).

---

### Phase 1 — Backtesting & Momentum (2–3 weeks)

* Time series hygiene: resampling, missing data, split by time (not random)
* Event-driven backtesting; vectorized sanity checks
* Performance metrics: CAGR, Sharpe, Sortino, hit-rate, turnover, max DD

**Project 1 – SMA/EMA Crossover (Daily) **
Rules: long when fast MA > slow MA, flat otherwise; include trading costs.
Deliverables:

* Notebook with signals & trade list
* `backtrader` or your own vectorized backtest
* Metrics table + equity curve + underwater plot
* Sensitivity sweep over (fast, slow) windows; heatmap of Sharpe
  *(Docs: backtrader quickstart & docs.)* ([backtrader.com][1])

---

### Phase 2 — Mean Reversion & Stat-Arb (3–4 weeks)

* Stationarity checks (ADF), cointegration (Engle-Granger), z-score spreads
* Position sizing by spread distance; rebalance/exit rules
* Robustness: rolling recalibration, out-of-sample validation
* Johansen Test (Multivariate Cointegration), Kalman Filter Spread Estimation, Regime-Switching Models, Distance-based / Clustering Methods

**Project 2 – Pairs Trading **
Steps: universe selection → hedge ratio → spread → z-score bands → trades.
Deliverables:

* Research notebook (tests, diagnostics)
* Walk-forward backtest with rolling window
* Stress tests (transaction costs ↑, delay, partial fills)
  *(Tooling: `statsmodels` tsa.)* ([StatsModels][2])

---

### Phase 3 — Volatility & Risk (3 weeks)

* ARCH/GARCH family, volatility clustering, fat tails
* Vol-targeting & dynamic leverage; risk budgeting; VaR/CVaR

**Project 3 – GARCH Vol Forecast **
Fit GARCH(1,1) on returns, produce 1-day vol forecasts, target 10% annual vol strategy (scale position = target/forecast).
Deliverables:

* `arch` model spec & diagnostics
* Strategy equity curve vs. fixed-size baseline
* Report on drawdown reduction
  *(Docs: `arch` univariate modeling.)* ([arch.readthedocs.io][3])

---

### Phase 4 — Portfolio Construction (2–3 weeks)

* Covariance estimation pitfalls; shrinkage; HRP; risk parity
* Combining alphas; turnover/risk controls; transaction-cost awareness

**Project 4 – Risk-Parity / HRP Portfolio **
Blend signals from P1–P3 across 10–30 assets; compare EW vs. MV vs. HRP.
Deliverables:

* Weight plots, cluster dendrogram (if HRP)
* Risk contribution chart & stability analysis
* Out-of-sample performance with quarterly re-opt
  *(Docs: PyPortfolioOpt user guide & HRP notes.)* ([pyportfolioopt.readthedocs.io][4])

---

### Phase 5 — ML for Alpha & Regime Detection (4–5 weeks)

* Feature engineering: returns, momentum, vol, cross-sectional ranks, macro lags
* Proper CV for time series (purged K-fold, embargo), feature drift checks
* Models: regularized linear, tree ensembles; calibrate to probability/score → position sizing
* Labeling & leakage avoidance

**Project 5 – ML Alpha Lab**
Train on 2012–2019, validate 2020–2022, test 2023–present; purged CV; shapley feature sanity.
Deliverables:

* Data pipeline scripts
* Model card (features, CV, metrics)
* Backtest with slippage & fee model (event-driven engine)
  *(Backtesting engine: backtrader/LEAN.)* ([backtrader.com][5], [QuantConnect][6])

---

### Phase 6 — Execution & Microstructure (2–3 weeks)

* Limit order book, queue priority; impact; VWAP/TWAP; child orders
* Simulation vs. paper trading; latency considerations

**Project 6 – Execution Simulator**
Paper-trade your best strategy with VWAP/TWAP and simple liquidity/impact model; compare realized vs. backtest fills.
Deliverables:

* Slippage attribution report
* Benchmarks: MKT vs. VWAP vs. POV
  *(Paper/live rails: IBKR TWS API, Alpaca.)* ([interactivebrokers.github.io][7], [Interactive Brokers][8], [docs.alpaca.markets][9])

---

### Phase 7 — Deployment & Ops (2–3 weeks)

* Orchestration (cron/Airflow), Docker, config & secrets, logging, alerts
* Risk limits (max position, DD stop, exposure), graceful kill-switch
* Paper → small capital live → monitoring

**Project 7 – Productionize One Strategy**
A repo with: infra scripts, config, broker adapter, risk checks, dashboards, and **paper trading** endpoints.
*(Broker SDKs & docs: IBKR, Alpaca; LEAN if you prefer.)* ([Interactive Brokers][10], [docs.alpaca.markets][11], [lean.io][12])

##  Risk & Validation Checklist (use every time)

* **Temporal splits** only; no peeking across time
* **Costs modeled** (commission + spread + slippage + borrow)
* **Drawdown controls** (max DD, max leverage, exposure caps)
* **Stability tests** (parameter randomness, re-estimation windows)
* **Out-of-sample** & **walk-forward** required
* **Kill-switch** and order throttling in live mode
* **Run logs** and trade blotter stored
---

## Certification Game-Plan (practical picks)

* **Short term (3–6 months):** sit **CFA Level I** for breadth or **FRM Part I** for risk core. ([CFA Institute], [GARP])
* **Medium term (6–12 months):** **FRM Part II** or **CMT Level I–II** if you want systematic/technical cred. ([GARP], [cmtassociation.org])
* **Advanced (6–12 months):** **CQF** for practitioner-level quant/ML modules & capstone. ([cqf.com])

---

##  Going Live — Two Practical Paths

* **Broker APIs:** IBKR TWS API (global markets, robust), Alpaca (simple equities/crypto). Start **paper** first. ([interactivebrokers.github.io][7], [docs.alpaca.markets][9])
* **Framework route:** QuantConnect **LEAN** (research → backtest → optimize → live) with CLI & Docker. ([QuantConnect][6])

---

##  Weekly Study Rhythm (sample)

* **Mon–Tue:** reading + notes + small experiments
* **Wed–Thu:** build/extend project, write tests
* **Fri:** backtest + stress tests + writeup
* **Sat:** paper review (arXiv/SSRN) + refactor + doc polish ([arXiv][17], [SSRN][18])
* **Sun:** rest/plan next sprint

---

## Final Tips

* Keep a **trade blotter** and **research log** (what changed & why).
* Prefer **simple, robust** rules over complex, fragile ones.
* Treat backtests as **estimates**; the market will disagree.
* Ship small, **iterate**, and promote only what survives paper trading.
